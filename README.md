# Yet another timer

A new Flutter project.

A minimalist multiplatform timer inspired in - the now defunct -[Lightning Talk](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lightning-talk-timer/id427769635?mt=8) by Yuichiro Wada. Developed using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). The initial goal of the project was to make Lightning Talk available to Android and plain web users. Now that the original timer disappeared from the Apple Store, the goal is to have it back also for iOS users. By taking advantage of Fluttter's multiplatform abilities, the timer will also be available for web use.
